# iOS Study Log Tracker - Production Ready Updates

## Summary of Improvements Applied

### 1. âœ… Pomodoro Timer UI Optimization
- **Issue**: Timer UI was too long causing layout overflow issues
- **Solution**: 
  - Reduced padding in timer type indicator from 10px to 8px
  - Decreased spacing from 16px to 12px 
  - Made fonts even smaller (14px â†’ 12px â†’ 11px)
  - Further reduced round indicator spacing to 4px
  - Made the timer display ultra-compact for better mobile experience

### 2. âœ… Task Total Time Display Fix
- **Issue**: Task tab showed 0 total time despite sessions being recorded correctly
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced DatabaseHelper with `recalculateTaskTotalTimes()` method
  - Added `getAllTasksWithTotalTimes()` that ensures accurate calculation from study sessions
  - Updated TaskProvider to use the enhanced database method
  - Task total times are now automatically refreshed after each study session
  - Integration properly set up in HomeScreen to refresh both statistics and tasks

### 3. âœ… Statistics Period Selector Layout Fix
- **Issue**: Checkmarks caused text wrapping when selecting Weekly/Monthly/All Time
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed layout with Container having fixed height (40px)
  - Wrapped text labels in FittedBox with scaleDown to prevent overflow
  - Reduced font size to 11px for better fit
  - Added consistent sizing constraints to prevent layout shifts

### 4. âœ… Study Days Implementation (Already Complete)
- **Feature**: Changed "Sessions" to "Study Days" showing unique days with study activity

  - StatisticsProvider calculates unique study days using `_calculateStudyDays()`
  - UI updated to display "Study Days" instead of "Sessions"
  - Proper counting of unique dates across all study sessions

### 5. âœ… Pie Chart Layout Matching
- **Issue**: Pie chart background didn't match bar chart width creating visual imbalance

  - Both charts now have consistent visual weight and alignment
